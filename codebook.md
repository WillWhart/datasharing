I took step 2 to to mean "select only the data whose names has 'mean(' or 'std('"
I got this from the "Clarify #2 in required R script" thread in the discussions on the
course project
this gave me 66 columns.
I use the labels for these columns, in order, from the original labels, along with subject number and activity number
I write (no row or column labels) this data for the first tidy data set. This data set has 10299 rows, each with 68 colums (subject index, anctivity index, subject index (1-30), activity index (1-6), and the 66 measurement columns). For a complete explanation of the variables, see

The titles of the columns are
