README for the file run_analysis.R
submitted for data cleaning course

This script is run without parameters
smallTidy <- run_analysis()
returning a small tidy data set and writing a larger one to disk
The script requires the following files from the Samsung data set in the working directory	## 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
"y_test.txt"
"subject_test.txt"
"y_train.txt"
"subject_train.txt"
"features.txt"
"X_test.txt"
"X_train.txt"


I took step 2 to to mean "select only the data whose names has 'mean(' or 'std('"
I got this from the "Clarify #2 in required R script" thread in the discussions on the
course project
this gave me 66 colums

I use the labels for these columns, in order, from the original labels, along with subject number and activity number
I write (no row or column labels) this data for the first tidy data set. This data set has 10299 rows, each with 68 colums (subject index, anctivity index, and the 66 measurement columns).
The names of the columns are
 [1] "subject"                     "activity"
